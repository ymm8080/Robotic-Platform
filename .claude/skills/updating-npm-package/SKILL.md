# Updating an npm Package

Use this skill when the user asks to update, upgrade, or bump a specific npm dependency.

## Steps

1. **Check the current version** — read `package.json` to find the installed version:

   ```bash
   npm ls <package-name>
   ```

2. **Find the latest version on npm** — fetch the package info:

   ```bash
   npm view <package-name> versions --json
   npm view <package-name> dist-tags --json
   ```

   This gives you the `latest` tag and all published versions.

3. **Determine the update type** — compare current version to latest:
   - **Patch** (1.2.3 → 1.2.4): bug fixes only
   - **Minor** (1.2.3 → 1.3.0): new features, backwards compatible
   - **Major** (1.2.3 → 2.0.0): breaking changes

4. **For patch or minor updates** — just do it:

   ```bash
   npm install <package-name>@latest
   ```

   Run the build and tests to make sure nothing broke:

   ```bash
   npm run build && npm test
   ```

   If everything passes, commit and report what changed.

5. **For major updates** — do a thorough investigation first:

   a. **Fetch the changelog and release notes** — check the package's GitHub repo for `CHANGELOG.md`, `MIGRATION.md`, or release notes. Use the web to find the official upgrade guide:

   ```
   Search: "<package-name> v<major> migration guide" OR "<package-name> v<major> upgrade guide"
   ```

   b. **Read the breaking changes** — identify every breaking change between the current and target version. Common things to check:
   - Removed or renamed APIs
   - Changed function signatures or return types
   - Dropped Node.js version support
   - New peer dependency requirements
   - Changed default behavior
   - Config file format changes

   c. **Scan the codebase for impact** — search for every usage of the package:

   ```bash
   # Find all imports
   grep -r "from ['\"]<package-name>" src/
   grep -r "require(['\"]<package-name>" src/
   ```

   For each usage, check if it's affected by a breaking change.

   d. **Apply the update**:

   ```bash
   npm install <package-name>@latest
   ```

   e. **Fix breaking changes** — update each affected usage based on the migration guide. Apply changes file by file.

   f. **Verify** — run the full suite:

   ```bash
   npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit && npm test && npm run build
   ```

   g. **Produce a migration report** — summarize:

   ```markdown
   ## Package Update: <package-name> v<old> → v<new> (Major)

   ### Breaking Changes Applied
   - `oldFunction()` renamed to `newFunction()` — updated in 3 files
   - Config format changed from `.js` to `.config.ts` — migrated
   - Dropped support for Node 16 — verified we're on Node 20

   ### Files Modified
   - src/lib/client.ts — updated import and function call
   - src/config/settings.ts — migrated config format
   - package.json — bumped version

   ### Validation
   - ✅ Lint passes
   - ✅ TypeScript compiles
   - ✅ All 47 tests pass
   - ✅ Build succeeds
   ```

## Notes

- Always check peer dependency compatibility before updating — `npm install` will warn about mismatches.
- For monorepos, check if the package is used in multiple workspaces and update them all together.
- If the package has a codemod tool (e.g. `npx @next/codemod`), use it instead of manual migration.
- Lock file (`package-lock.json`) changes are expected — commit them with the update.
